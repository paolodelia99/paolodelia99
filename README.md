### Hi there, I'm Paolo 👋

I recently graduated with a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen, and former DevOps Engineer at Nordea Markets in the Quantitative Research team. My journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in Python programming and C++ programming, and I’ve developed a deep interest in Quantitative Finance.

I'm particularly interested in learning more about Low-latency programming and trading systems in C++. If you share these interests or have knowledge to share on these topics, I’d love to connect!

- 🔭 I’m currently focused on expanding my knowledge in Low-latency programming and trading systems.
- 🌱 I’m learning more about Python, C++ programming, and their applications in Quantitative Finance.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with others who are passionate about Quantitative Finance.
