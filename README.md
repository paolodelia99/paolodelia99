### Hi there, I'm Paolo ðŸ‘‹

I recently graduated with a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen, and former Student DevOps Engineer at Nordea Markets in the Quantitative Research team. My journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in Python programming and C++ programming, and Iâ€™ve developed a deep interest in Quantitative Finance.

I'm particularly interested in learning more about Quantum Computing and Quantum Mechanics. If you share these interests or have knowledge to share on these topics, Iâ€™d love to connect!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focused on expanding my knowledge in Quantum Computing and Quantum Mechanics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning more about Python, C++ programming, and their applications in Quantitative Finance.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with others who are passionate about Quantitative Finance or Quantum Computing.
