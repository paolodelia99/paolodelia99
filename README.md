### Hi there, I'm Paolo 👋

I’m passionate about **Quantitative Finance** and the intersection of finance and software development.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen and have over two years of professional experience in the finance industry, working at **Nordea Markets** as a DevOps Engineer and at **Intesa Sanpaolo** as a Software Engineer. My work focuses on building reliable, high-performance software solutions, with a growing interest in applying my skills to **quantitative finance**.

I actively contribute to [**QuantLib**](https://www.quantlib.org/), the leading open-source C++ library for quantitative finance, and enjoy exploring Python, C++, and numerical methods for real-world financial applications.

💡 Interests: Quant Finance, Python, C++, high-performance computing, numerical methods
