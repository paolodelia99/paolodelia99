### Hi there, Paolo here ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a third year Computer Science student at Unimib. I am really passionate about the world of coding, AI and everything related to computer science and tech.

I'm also a really sporty guy, I'm going to the gym between 4 and 5 times a week. What's sport taught me is **discipline** and **determination**, that allows me to getting done faster the "boring stuff" and have time to dedicate the to things that I've love to do!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Deep Learning, Timeseries forecasting, and Reinforcement Learning related projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data science, machine learning and deep learning
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with data scientist
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **anything**
